## Work Experience

### TikTok Inc. (May 2023 - Now)
**Software Engineer, Search Back-end**  
Languages/Technologies: go, java // FLink, ETL, distributed systems, back-end web development
- Completed the migration of the TikTok Live indexing pipeline from Go + TCE to the Java + Flink framework, resulting in a substantial decrease in latency by 60.8% and a 33% reduction in output QPS.
- Built an offline monitoring dashboard for the TikTok search operations, elevating visibility into index flows. This enhancement not only streamlines traffic statistics but also simplifies issue tracking and resolution.
- Built Batch indexing life-cycle management system which simplified the feeding process, enhancing the efficiency, controllability and transparency of the batch indexing tasks.

### Google Inc. (Aug 2018 - Mar 2023)
**Software Engineer, Events Search/What-to-X/Recipes Search**  
Languages/Technologies: C++, python // Recommendation System, semi-structured search, back-end web development, Knowledge Graphs, ETL, distributed system, quality evaluation and analysis
- Implemented the back-end of personalized recommendation feature for “food” and “dish” recipes queries.
- Developed and deployed an author book feature that displays books authored by an author when user search for him/her, which brought 87% increases in book item iterations.
- Set up the live experiments and query satisfactions surveys with real traffic for latency and quality evaluation. Compared to the first launch candidate, 3 major improvements reduces 65% latency increases.
- Developed and maintained an end-to-end distributed and batch-processing data pipeline for ETL processing from Web docs to Knowledge Graphs. Throughput is around 30TB/day.
- Designed events related metadata(source page, ticketing URL, event status and so on) schema and completed the data on-boarding on Knowledge Engine.
- Designed and Implemented the monitoring system for the counters fluctuations in events data pipeline.

### Marlabs Inc. (Feb 2018 - Jul 2018)
**Software Development Engineer, Trainee**  
Languages/Technologies: Scala // Spark, MapReduce, Hive, Kafka, Hortonworks  
Big Data Engineering. Used computation frameworks and applications such as Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, Hive or Kafka to process data and build data pipelines within Hortonworks Data Platform.


## Academic Projects
### Open Source Project Contribution | Alluxio 
April 2017

*	Contributed to Open Source Project Alluxio in a collaborative development environment on GitHub. Alluxio is a virtual distributed storage system. It enables any application to interact with any data from any storage system at memory speed.
*	Added sub-command functionality to provide help message for ‘bin/alluxio fs’. 
*	Completed corresponding remote debugging and unit test.

### Stock Information Web Application
Mar 2017

*	Build a web application that displays real-time price changes for a given stock.
*	Used Kafka as Data Ingestion layer, Redis as Data Storage layer, and smoothie.js to visualize data.
Course Selection Helper for Stevens | Web Server and Wechat API        June 2016
*	Built WeChat interface, using Nginx, uWSGI and Flask as the framework to run Python applications.
*	Built a web application which manages course information by Node.js. It provides dashboards reporting grade distributions, course intensity, course evaluations and course enrollments. 
*	Project being highlighted on poster board during 2016 IEEE symposium.

### Popular Place Recommendation Base on GPS data | Data Mining           
June 2014

*	Completed data mining project to report the top ten most popular sites in Beijing to government department for tourism development. 
*	Used DBSCAN algorithm to cluster points of stay. Filtered out redundant clusters where users visited periodically like homes, offices and stations. 
*	Generated 352 clusters form 24,876,978 GPS points of 182 users. Used HITS algorithm to evaluate the users and clusters, then obtained final recommendation.
*	Generated visual display and reports on results of the analysis using Baidu Map APIs.
